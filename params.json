You can check table with detailed list of implemented services below;\r\n- All configuration files cleaned up and optimized for REST API;\r\n- Integrated Swagger doc specification in `doc` folder;\r\n- Integrated Mocha tests for all `blueprints`, `controllers`, `models`, `policies`, `responses` and `services`. After generating you can execute `npm test`;\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nStart using generator is very simple.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need install **yeoman** and **generator-sails-rest-api**:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g yo generator-sails-rest-api\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen create project directory and initiate the generator under the project directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir my-project\r\ncd my-project\r\nyo sails-rest-api\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will be prompted for questions. Answer to those questions that generator is asks and you will get configured Sails project.\r\n\r\nAfter scaffolding the project you can use this project as before. Just run the `app.js` file and all.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnode app.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you just have setup your first Sails REST API :+1:\r\n\r\n## How to use project code?\r\n\r\n_TODO:_ Fill with information. But you can read more at our [wiki page](https://github.com/ghaiklor/generator-sails-rest-api/wiki/How-to-use)\r\n\r\n## Bundled Sails services\r\n\r\n|  Service Name  |               Implemented providers              |\r\n|:--------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|\r\n| CipherService  | bcrypt, JWT                                      |\r\n| MailerService  | Mandrill                                         |\r\n| PaymentService | Stripe                                           |\r\n| PusherService  | Apple Push Notifications, Google Cloud Messaging |\r\n| SmsService     | Twilio                                           |\r\n| SocialService  | Facebook                                         |\r\n| StorageService | Amazon S3, Google Cloud                          |\r\n\r\n## How can I get latest dev version of generator?\r\n\r\nRight now this generator is extremely under development, so each day our `dev` branch has new updates and fixes.\r\n\r\nIf you want get the latest updates, you should do this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ghaiklor/generator-sails-rest-api.git # Clone the repository\r\ncd generator-sails-rest-api # Change directory\r\nnpm link # Link current directory to global module\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that our git repository will be linked to your global npm module and you can use it as described above.\r\n\r\nIf any updates will come you can just pull the last changes and call generator again:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd generator-sails-rest-api\r\ngit pull\r\nyo sails-rest-api\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2015 Eugene Obrezkov\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
